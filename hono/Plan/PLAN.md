# Onboarding Portal — Backend Plan

## Stack Recommendations

### ORM: Drizzle ORM (recommended over Prisma)
| | Drizzle | Prisma |
|---|---|---|
| Bun support | Native, first-class | Works but has query engine overhead |
| Performance | Direct SQL, no runtime overhead | Extra query engine process |
| Type-safety | Full, SQL-like syntax | Full, custom DSL |
| Migrations | Lightweight `drizzle-kit` | Heavier CLI |
| Bundle size | ~50KB | ~2MB+ engine |

**Verdict:** Drizzle aligns perfectly with the Bun + Hono lightweight philosophy.

### Email: Nodemailer + SMTP (recommended over Resend)
| | Nodemailer + SMTP | Resend |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Free (use Brevo free 300/day, or your own SMTP) | Free tier: 100/day, then paid |
| Vendor lock-in | None — swap SMTP providers anytime | Tied to Resend API |
| Templates | Use any templating (React Email, MJML, Handlebars) | React Email built-in |
| Setup | Moderate | Very easy |
| Control | Full control over delivery | Managed |

**Verdict:** Nodemailer gives you flexibility. In production, point it at Brevo, Mailgun, or your own SMTP relay. Zero lock-in.

### File Storage: Google Drive for now, Hetzner Object Storage later
Google Drive can be used in the first version if the business needs document access restricted to company Google accounts.

**Recommended temporary approach:**
- Upload documents to Google Drive through the backend
- Create a dedicated folder structure per merchant
- Store `file_id`, `folder_id`, filename, mime type, checksum, and links in the database
- Restrict file sharing to approved company Google accounts only
- Keep audit logs for upload, access, review, and replacement actions

**Long-term direction:**
- Abstract storage behind a provider interface
- Start with Google Drive as the current provider
- Migrate later to Hetzner Object Storage without changing business logic

### Auth: Custom JWT (access + refresh tokens)
For this specific flow (admin-created users, direct password creation, RBAC with policies), a custom implementation gives the most control.

- **Access token:** 15-min expiry, stored in memory on frontend
- **Refresh token:** 7-day expiry, stored in httpOnly cookie + DB
- **Password hashing:** `Bun.password.hash()` (built-in Argon2)

### Deployment: Hetzner + Coolify
Use Hetzner infrastructure with Coolify for deployment orchestration and server management.

**Recommended setup:**
- Hetzner VPS
- Coolify-managed application deployment
- Docker image/container deployment through Coolify
- PostgreSQL hosted on the same server or a separate managed node
- Coolify-managed SSL, domains, and reverse proxy

## Case Stages

Case stages are case-dependent. There is no single global stage pipeline for all case types.

Each queue or case type should define:

- its own list of allowed stages
- its own default starting stage
- its own allowed transitions
- whether QC exists for that case type

Examples:

- Documents Review: `New → Working → Pending Merchant → Closed`
- Agreement: `New → Drafting → Pending Merchant → Review → Closed`
- MID: `New → Working → Credentials Ready → Testing Limits Applied → Closed`
- Going Live: `New → Working → Live Limits Applied → Closed`
- Support Ticket: can have its own independent flow later

Implementation note:

- Store stage definitions in the database instead of hardcoding one enum for all cases
- Validate every stage transition against the case type's allowed workflow

---

## User Roles & Access

Use a single `users` table, but separate platform authority from operational access rules.

### Platform Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Super Admin | Full access to everything, including admin creation |
| Admin | Full access except super admin actions |

### Operational Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Supervisor | Access to assigned queues + user work stats |
| Employee | Access to assigned queues only |

### User Creation Hierarchy

| Creator Role | Can Create |
|---|---|
| Super Admin | Admin, Supervisor, Employee |
| Admin | Supervisor, Employee |
| Supervisor | Employee |
| Employee | No user creation access |

Rules:

- Seed exactly one initial `super_admin`
- Do not expose `create super_admin` in the UI after initial setup
- Only a `super_admin` can create an `admin`
- `admin` can create `supervisor` and `employee`
- `supervisor` can create `employee`
- No public self-registration
- Every created user should store `created_by_user_id` for auditability

**Access Policy flow:**
1. Create a policy → give it a name + select queues
2. Assign the policy to a user
3. User can only see/work cases in their allowed queues
4. Access policies mainly apply to `supervisor` and `employee` operational scope

---

## User Creation Flow

```
Authorized user creates user (name, email, employee_id, role, policy, password)
       │
       ▼
Backend validates that the creator is allowed to create the target role
       │
       ▼
User is created immediately in active state
       │
       ▼
Optional email is sent to the user with account details or login instructions
```

Notes:

- `super_admin` creation should be disabled after initial bootstrap
- `admin` users should not be controlled only by queue policy; they also have platform-level permissions
- `supervisor` and `employee` should use access policies for queue-based restrictions

---

## Merchant Statuses (Enum)

```
form_submitted → documents_review → sub_merchant → agreement → testing → live → suspended
```

---

## Missing Features to Add

### Critical (Include Now)
1. **Audit logging** — Log every action (who, what, when, IP). Essential for compliance.
2. **Soft deletes** — Never hard-delete merchants, cases, or users.
3. **Email log** — Record every email sent (deliverability tracking, debugging).
4. **File type/size validation** — Enforce allowed types and max sizes on uploads.
5. **Rate limiting** — On all public endpoints (form submission, token verification).
6. **CORS configuration** — Lock down allowed origins.
7. **Input sanitization** — All merchant form fields (XSS prevention).
8. **Credential encryption** — MID credentials must be AES-encrypted at rest, not plaintext.
9. **Merchant status tracking** — Dedicated status enum (see above).
10. **Case priority levels** — High/Medium/Low for triage.

### Important (Phase 2)
11. **SLA tracking** — Time in each case stage, alerts when overdue.
12. **Auto-assignment rules** — Round-robin or load-based case assignment.
13. **Case escalation** — Auto-escalate if case sits in a stage too long.
14. **Merchant self-service portal** — Let merchants check their onboarding status.
15. **Bulk operations** — Assign/close multiple cases at once.
16. **Search** — Full-text search across merchants, cases, comments.
17. **Export/Reports** — CSV/Excel export of merchants, cases.
18. **2FA for portal users** — TOTP-based (Google Authenticator).
19. **Password policies** — Minimum length, complexity, expiry.
20. **Activity feed** — Dashboard showing real-time org-wide activity.

### Nice to Have (Phase 3)
21. **Email template editor** — Admin-editable email templates.
22. **Webhook support** — Notify external systems on status changes.
23. **Form builder** — Configurable onboarding form fields.
24. **Merchant categories** — Different onboarding flows per merchant type.
25. **API rate limiting per user** — Throttle heavy users.
